# DataOrtho Notebooks
These notebooks were constructed on a Windows 10 OS, it is advisable to run them on a specific created environment (env,conda, etc.). For the modellingortho.ipynb components such as: CUDA 11.2, cuDNN 8.1 and Python 3.8.18 were used. However these were special requirements for a specific GPU, check your useable CUDA version and the required version of each component in order to run the notebook.
